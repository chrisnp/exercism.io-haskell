standard tests
  null
    sets with no elements are empty
    sets with elements are not empty
  member
    nothing is contained in an empty set
    when the element is in the set
    when the element is not in the set
  isSubsetOf
    empty set is a subset of another empty set
    empty set is a subset of non-empty set
    non-empty set is not a subset of empty set
    set is a subset of set with exact same elements
    set is a subset of larger set with same elements
    set is not a subset of set that does not contain its elements
  isDisjointFrom
    the empty set is disjoint with itself
    empty set is disjoint with non-empty set
    non-empty set is disjoint with empty set
    sets are not disjoint if they share an element
    sets are disjoint if they share no elements
  Eq
    empty sets are equal
    empty set is not equal to non-empty set
    non-empty set is not equal to empty set
    sets with the same elements are equal
    sets with different elements are not equal
    set is not equal to larger set with same elements
  insert
    add to empty set
    add to non-empty set
    adding an existing element does not change the set
  intersection
    intersection of two empty sets is an empty set
    intersection of an empty set and non-empty set is an empty set
    intersection of a non-empty set and an empty set is an empty set
    intersection of two sets with no shared elements is an empty set
    intersection of two sets with shared elements is a set of the shared elements
  difference
    difference of two empty sets is an empty set
    difference of empty set and non-empty set is an empty set
    difference of a non-empty set and an empty set is the non-empty set
    difference of two non-empty sets is a set of elements that are only in the first set
  union
    union of empty sets is an empty set
    union of an empty set and non-empty set is the non-empty set
    union of a non-empty set and empty set is the non-empty set
    union of non-empty sets contains all unique elements
track-specific tests
  delete
    delete existing element
  size
    size of an empty set is zero
    size is the number of elements
    size doesn't count repetition in `fromList`
    size does count inserted element
    size doesn't count element removed by `delete`
  toList
    an empty set has an empty list of elements
    a set has the list of its elements
    a set doesn't keep repeated elements
