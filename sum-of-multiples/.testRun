sumOfMultiples
  [3,5] 1 -- no multiples within limit
  [3,5] 4 -- one factor has multiples within limit
  [3] 7 -- more than one multiple within limit
  [3,5] 10 -- more than one factor with multiples within limit
  [3,5] 100 -- each multiple is only counted once
  [3,5] 1000 -- a much larger limit
  [7,13,17] 20 -- three factors
  [4,6] 15 -- factors not relatively prime
  [5,6,8] 150 -- some pairs of factors relatively prime and some not
  [5,25] 51 -- one factor is a multiple of another
  [43,47] 10000 -- much larger factors
  [1] 100 -- all numbers are multiples of 1
  [] 10000 -- no factors means an empty sum
  [0] 1 -- the only multiple of 0 is 0
  [3,0] 4 -- the factor 0 does not affect the sum of multiples of other factors
  [2,3,5,7,11] 10000 -- solutions using include-exclude must extend to cardinality greater than 3
